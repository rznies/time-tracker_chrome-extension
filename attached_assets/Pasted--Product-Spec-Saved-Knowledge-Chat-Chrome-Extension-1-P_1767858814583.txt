# Product Spec: Saved Knowledge Chat Chrome Extension

## 1. Product Overview

Saved Knowledge Chat is a Chrome extension that lets users save highlighted text from anywhere on the internet and later chat exclusively with what they’ve saved. It acts as a second brain for serious internet users: entrepreneurs, working professionals, content creators, and indie hackers who accumulate high-signal information over time and want reliable recall weeks or months later.

The product optimizes for trust, precision, and long-term value over novelty or automation.

## 2. Core User Promise

* Anything you save becomes part of your personal knowledge vault
* The system never invents information outside your saved data
* Every answer is grounded in your own sources and explicitly cited
* Weeks later, you can ask natural language questions and get shockingly relevant answers

## 3. Target User

**Explicitly for:**

* Entrepreneurs
* Working professionals
* Content creators
* Indie hackers

**Explicitly not for:**

* Casual web users
* Passive readers
* Users looking for generic AI answers

## 4. Core Concepts & Definitions

### 4.1 Atomic Unit: Snippet

A **Snippet** is the smallest unit of saved knowledge.

Each snippet represents *evidence supporting a larger idea*, not a standalone truth.

**Snippet contains:**

* Cleaned, formatted text (what the user selected)
* Source URL
* DOM position (XPath / CSS selector)
* Timestamp of save
* Frozen text snapshot

Snippets are never auto-merged or clustered in v1.

## 5. Save Flow

### 5.1 Trigger

* User selects text on any webpage
* User opens extension popup
* Clicks “Save”

### 5.2 UX Principles

* Explicit save only (no ambient capture)
* Instant feedback (<300ms perceived latency)
* No required title, tags, or notes at save time
* Confirmation message: “Saved”

## 6. Home UI (Extension Popup)

### 6.1 Default View

* **Recent Saves list** (most recent first)
* Each item shows:

  * Truncated snippet text
  * Source domain
  * Timestamp

Purpose: Immediate confirmation that the system is working.

### 6.2 Secondary Entry: Chat

* Prominent chat input
* Multi-threaded conversations
* Each thread is user-named or auto-titled

### 6.3 Progress Signal

A simple counter visible in the UI:

“You have **X insights** across **Y domains**”

This reinforces accumulation and ownership.

## 7. Chat Behavior

### 7.1 Scope

* Default scope: **All saved snippets**
* No filtering, tagging, or collections in v1

### 7.2 Answer Shape

1. Synthesized response at the top
2. Expandable list of cited snippets below

### 7.3 Rules

* The system can only answer using saved snippets
* Claims must be grounded in citations
* If no relevant snippets exist:

  * Explicit response: “You haven’t saved anything related to this yet.”

### 7.4 Latency

* Target response time: 5–8 seconds
* Prefer partial answers over long waits

---

## 8. Trust & Transparency

* Sources always shown (expandable)
* No hallucination fallback
* No external knowledge injection
* Clear refusal when data is missing

This positions the product as a *vault*, not a chatbot.

---

## 9. Auto-Tags (Internal Only)

* Auto-generated tags exist only for retrieval
* Never exposed to the user
* Precision > recall
* False positives are worse than false negatives

---

## 10. Data & Privacy

### 10.1 What Can Be Saved

* Public internet text only
* No document uploads
* No offline files
* No personal notes

### 10.2 Storage Model

* User-specific isolated data stores
* No shared vector space across users
* Cleaned text snapshots only (no raw HTML)

### 10.3 Deletion

* Immediate removal from retrieval and chat
* 5-minute undo window
* No trash folder
* Deleted content is never logged

---

## 11. Technical Architecture (v1)

### 11.1 Indexing

* Real-time indexing on save
* One embedding per snippet

### 11.2 Retrieval

* Vector similarity search over user’s snippet store
* Internal auto-tags assist retrieval

### 11.3 Embeddings Lifecycle

* Embeddings are regenerated when models improve
* Cost is accepted as a retention investment

### 11.4 Offline Behavior

* Read-only access to recent saves
* No chat functionality offline

---

## 12. Edge Case Decisions (Locked for v1)

* Multiple highlights from same page = multiple snippets
* Same text from different URLs is preserved separately
* Snippets do not expire
* Full export available (JSON + Markdown)

---

## 13. Success Criteria (30-Day Behavior)

* User develops habit of saving small, frequent snippets
* User returns weeks later and asks recall-style questions
* User trusts “no answer” responses
* User perceives growing long-term value, not instant novelty

---

## 14. Explicit Non-Goals (v1)

* Auto-clustering or topic graphs
* User-managed tags or folders
* AI-generated summaries at save time
* Social or sharing features

---

## 15. Product Philosophy

This tool does less, deliberately.

It does not try to think for the user.
It preserves what the user found valuable.
It earns trust by refusing to guess.

The intelligence is in recall, not creativity.
